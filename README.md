# leetcode

Repo containing my attempts, results and comments relating to solving Leetcode programming problems in various programming languages (mostly Python). The aim being to solve these to refresh on computer science concepts learnt in uni, with ideally a better than average result (score >55% compared with other Leetcode online submissions).
